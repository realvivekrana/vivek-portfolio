# How to Add Your Profile Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your photo** from the chat/message where you shared it
   - Right-click on the image
   - Select "Save image as..."
   - Name it exactly: `profile.jpg`

2. **Place the photo** in the correct folder:
   - Navigate to: `vivek-portfolio/public/`
   - Copy/paste `profile.jpg` into this folder

3. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + F5 or Cmd + Shift + R)
   - Your photo will appear automatically!

## File Location:
```
vivek-portfolio/
  └── public/
      └── profile.jpg  ← Put your photo here
```

## Important:
- File name must be exactly: `profile.jpg` (lowercase)
- Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png
- Recommended size: 500x500 pixels or larger
- The image will be automatically cropped to a circle

## Current Status:
Until you add the photo, you'll see a placeholder with your initials "VKR" in a gradient circle.
